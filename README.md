Citibike Tableau Analysis

The data source for this Tableau analysis was from https://citibikenyc.com/system-data, a site offering data on the citibike bike sharing program in New York City. 

The data used was from September of 2019.

Visualizations include maps and bar charts showing usage of start and ending destinations. Usage by gender and age were visualized, however the data was not precise as gender was unknown for approximately one third of the riders and a likely artificial number of riders entered their birth years as 1969 and pre-1900. Bike usage by ID was visualized in a bar chart and linked to the maps to show where the bike had been when the ID was clicked on in the bar chart.
